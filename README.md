I'm a customer-focused [Software Engineer](https://linkedin.com/in/francismitra) with a founder's perspective. I'm as comfortable validating products as I am building them.

I'm currently based in New York, but have worked, lived, and studied around the world. I've worked with companies to build products that drove user growth by millions of users over a year (a growth of 400%) and coalesced with investors to start new ventures in emerging markets like Yangon, Myanmar.
