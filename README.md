I'm a customer-focused [Software Engineer](https://linkedin.com/in/francismitra) with a founder's perspective. I'm as comfortable validating products as I am building them.

I'm currently based in New York, but have worked, lived, and studied around the world. I've exited a start up in Manila, Philippines through acquisition, raised capital through the start up accelerator JFDI in Singapore, bootstrapped a company in Yangon, Myanmar, and attended MIT for their Entrepreneurship Bootcamp in Cambridge, MA.
