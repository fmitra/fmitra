I'm a customer-focused [Software Engineer](https://linkedin.com/in/francismitra) from the United States interested in creating products and services that answer common pain points.

I'm currently based in New York but have extensive experience in international markets as part of a team in Manila, Philippines (acquired in 2020) and as previous founder in Yangon, Myanmar (disbanded in 2016).
